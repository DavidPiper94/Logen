/**
 * This enum provides convenient access to the keys which are used to access the localized strings.
 * It extents the class LocalizableKeys, which provides a base class for all generated enums.
 * The class LocalizableKeys is part of the MaternaAppKit-Framework which can be added to the project with cocoapods.
 *
 * Example for usage:
 * ```
 * let key = LocalizableKeys.some_value_of_this_enum.rawValue
 * let value = Localizer.string(forKey: key)
 * ```
